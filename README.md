# PDF-Merger
Simple program I made for myself, written in Python and Qt5 to merge several PDFs.
NOTE: It takes as input an entire folder, instead of individually-picked documents. This is because usually if you want to merge differente PDF documents, they will most likely share a common theme and will therefore probably be best allocated in a separate folder (feel free to modify to source code though).
